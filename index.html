						<h1>NYUbie Starter Guide</h1>

						<p>Hello and welcome to BetterNYU, a webiste with information on what NYU students 
						<i>really</i> need to know to take advantage of
						everything that their school has to offer them. If you're a freshman
						or have never visited the site before, then this is a good starting 
						point. </p>
						<p>Below you'll find just a few helpful resources to get you going.
						Afterwards, please feel free to browse the site! The goal of this site
						is to sift through all the information and perks relevant to NYU students,
						and provide it straight to you, without the needlessness of throwing
						different information across different NYU websites.
						</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class = "page row" id = "Clubs AND Campus Map">
					<div class = "col-sm-6">
						<h3>Discounts</h3>

						<p>Your NYU ID allows you to get discounts on tons of software, stores, and attractions.
							For a full and comprehensive 
							list of the grand majority of disocunts you get as an NYU student, go to the <a href="Software.html">General Discounts List</a>.
							More discounts are peppered throughout the "Deals and Discounts" tab.</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "col-sm-6">
						<h3>Professor Evaluations</h3>

						<p>Most students eventually come
							across <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/" target = "_blank">ratemyprofessor.com</a>, but
							did you know certain schools of NYU offer their course/teacher evaluations for public viewing? 
							visit the <a href="Textbooks and Teachers.html">Teacher Evaluations page</a> to see if your school of NYU is one of them.</p>
					</div>

				</div>


				<div class = "page row" id = "Software AND Text and Teach">
					<div class = "col-sm-6">
						<h3>Textbooks</h3>

						<p>Renting has recently become a popular option when looking for textbooks, as well as buying international versions of textbooks for
							much cheaper prices. Bobst also has more textbooks than they let on. When that doesn't work,
							visit the <a href="Software.html#books">textbook page</a> to find the best deal.</p>
					</div>

					<div class = "col-sm-6">
						<h3>Career Development</h3>

						<p>Having work experience by the time you graduate is important, so you better start hunting now for internships. NYU graduate
							students also have the option of participating in any of the research labs that NYU maintains. Visit the <a href="Career Development.html">Career Development page</a>
							for more information. </p>
